About:
	Program written in this work is controlled with help BTN1 and BTN2 from PIC32MZ2048EFG100.
	We have 4 different speeds. BTN1 sets them.
	BTN2 is starts flashing leds like a wave with a given speed.

	The project was written and tested on a microcontroller PIC32MZ2048EFG100.

Build:
	The project is compiled using the Makefile. But i used standart Makefile from MPLAB IDE.
	My dear friend in file with path nhutsenko\lab1-BasicIO\lab\laba1.X\nbproject\Makefile-local-default.mk you should to change ways to compiler and IDE.
