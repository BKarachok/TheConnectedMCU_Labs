In this lab, the speed of program execution is increased by speeding up the memory system. To evaluate the performance of the processor and the memory system, a program is used that adds all the elements of the two-\/dimensional array of integers located in the static R\+AM. The array sizes are defined by the parameters N\+U\+M\+\_\+\+R\+O\+WS and N\+U\+M\+\_\+\+C\+O\+LS. A prefetch module is used.
