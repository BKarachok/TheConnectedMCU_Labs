In this laboratory work, a program was developed to control the brightness of the LED using a potentiometer. Turning the potentiometer knob changes the voltage that is applied to the analog port. This voltage is measured by the ADC. The timer generates a PWM signal whose duty cycle varies depending on the measured voltage. Thus, the brightness of the LED is changed by turning the potentiometer knob.
The display of the brightness level with three LEDs was realized: a low level - one LED is on, an average level is 2, high is 3. Indication occurs only when the BTN1 button is pressed and held.
